A tag cloud widget which exposes more of the internal Wordpress tagcloud 
options.

== Description ==

F2 Tag Cloud Widegt is an enhanced tag cloud widget that provides some 
additional options compared to the default widget provided with WordPress. 
The additional options are:

* minimum tag text size
* maximum tag text size
* maximum tag count
* tag cloud format
* tag ordering

These are all options provided by the tag cloud functions within WordPress, 
but for some reason are not exposed by their own widget. The full details 
of these options are explained in the main WordPress documentation.
