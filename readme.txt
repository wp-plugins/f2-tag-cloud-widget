A tag cloud widget which exposes more of the internal Wordpress tagcloud 
options.

== Description ==

F2 Tag Cloud Widegt is an enhanced tag cloud widget that provides some 
additional options compared to the default widget provided with WordPress. 
The additional options are:

of these options are explained in the main WordPress documentation.
